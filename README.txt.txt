Sorting Algorithm Visualizer 

The project is a web-based Sorting Algorithm Visualizer that allows users to observe and understand how different sorting algorithms work by visually representing the sorting process. It provides a user-friendly interface where users can interact with various sorting algorithms, such as Bubble Sort, Insertion Sort, Selection Sort, Quick Sort, and Merge Sort.

Upon loading the web application, the user is presented with an array of bars, each representing a numerical value. The height of each bar corresponds to the value it represents. The application allows the user to adjust the size of the array and the speed of the sorting algorithm using sliders.

Users can then select a specific sorting algorithm from the available options, and upon clicking the corresponding button, the sorting algorithm is executed. During the sorting process, the application visually represents the comparisons and swaps being made by changing the color of the bars accordingly. The application also provides real-time updates on the number of comparisons and swaps made during the sorting process.

The web application's interface is designed to dynamically update and reflect the changes happening within the sorting algorithms, giving users a clear visualization of how each algorithm works and the differences in their approaches to sorting data. Overall, the project serves as an educational tool to help users comprehend the inner workings of various sorting algorithms and their respective efficiencies.
